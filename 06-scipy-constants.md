## SciPy - Constants



SciPy constants package provides a wide range of constants, which are used in the general scientific area.

#### 1. SciPy Constants Package
The scipy.constants package provides various constants. We have to import the required constant and use them as per the requirement. Let us see how these constant variables are imported and used.
To start with, let us compare the ‘pi’ value by considering the following example.


```python
#Import pi constant from both the packages
import scipy.constants
import math

from scipy.constants import pi
from math import pi
```


```python
print("sciPy - pi = %.16f"%scipy.constants.pi)
print("math - pi = %.16f"%math.pi)
```

    sciPy - pi = 3.1415926535897931
    math - pi = 3.1415926535897931


### List of Constants Available
The following tables describe in brief the various constants.

#### Mathematical Constants

1. ``pi``: pi
2. ``golden``: Golden Ratio

#### Physical Constants
The following table lists the most commonly used physical constants.

1. ``c``: Speed of light in vacuum
2. ``speed_of_light``: Speed of light in vacuum
3. ``h``: Planck constant
4. ``Planck``: Planck constant h
5. ``G``: Newton’s gravitational constant
6. ``e``: Elementary charge
7. ``R``: Molar gas constant
8. ``Avogadro``: Avogadro constant
9. ``k``: Boltzmann constant
10. ``electron_mass``(OR) ``m_e``: Electronic mass
11. ``proton_mass`` (OR) ``m_p``: Proton mass
12. ``neutron_mass``(OR)``m_n``: Neutron mass

#### Units

The following table has the list of SI units.

1. ``milli``: 0.001
2. ``micro``: 1e-06
3. ``kilo``: 1000
    
These units range from yotta, zetta, exa, peta, tera ……kilo, hector, …nano, pico, … to zepto.

#### Other Important Constants
The following table lists other important constants used in SciPy.

1. ``gram``: 0.001 kg
2. ``tomic mass``: Atomic mass constant
3. ``degree``: Degree in radians
4. ``inute``: One minute in seconds
5. ``day``: One day in seconds
6. ``inch``: One inch in meters
7. ``micron``: One micron in meters
8. light_year One light-year in meters
9. atm Standard atmosphere in pascals
10. ``acre``: One acre in square meters
11. liter One liter in cubic meters
12. gallon One gallon in cubic meters
13. kmh Kilometers per hour in meters per seconds
14. degree_Fahrenheit One Fahrenheit in kelvins
15. eV One electron volt in joules
16. ``hp``: One horsepower in watts
17. dyn One dyne in newtons
18. lambda2nu



#### Convert wavelength to optical frequency
Remembering all of these are a bit tough. The easy way to get which key is for which function is with the scipy.constants.find() method. Let us consider the following example.



```python
import scipy.constants
res = scipy.constants.physical_constants["alpha particle mass"]
print(res)


```

    (6.64465723e-27, 'kg', 8.2e-35)



```python
The above program will generate the following output.
[
   'alpha particle mass',
   'alpha particle mass energy equivalent',
   'alpha particle mass energy equivalent in MeV',
   'alpha particle mass in u',
   'electron to alpha particle mass ratio'
]

```


```python
This method returns the list of keys, else nothing if the keyword does not match.

```
