## SciPy Tutorial

SciPy, a scientific library for Python is an open source, BSD-licensed library for mathematics, science and engineering. The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The main reason for building the SciPy library is that, it should work with NumPy arrays. It provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical practices such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. This is an introductory tutorial, which covers the fundamentals of SciPy and describes how to deal with its various modules.
Audience
