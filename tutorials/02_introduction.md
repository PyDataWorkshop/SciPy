SciPy, pronounced as Sigh Pi, is a scientific python open source, distributed under the BSD licensed library to perform Mathematical, Scientific and Engineering Computations.
The SciPy library depends on NumPy, which provides convenient and fast N-dimensional array manipulation. The SciPy library is built to work with NumPy arrays and provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical practices such as routines for numerical integration and optimization. Together, they run on all popular operating systems, are quick to install and are free of charge. NumPy and SciPy are easy to use, but powerful enough to depend on by some of the world's leading scientists and engineers.
SciPy Sub-packages
SciPy is organized into sub-packages covering different scientific computing domains. These are summarized in the following table âˆ’
scipy.cluster
Vector quantization / Kmeans
scipy.constants
Physical and mathematical constants
scipy.fftpack
Fourier transform
scipy.integrate
Integration routines
scipy.interpolate
Interpolation
scipy.io
Data input and output
scipy.linalg
Linear algebra routines
scipy.ndimage
n-dimensional image package
scipy.odr
Orthogonal distance regression
scipy.optimize
Optimization
scipy.signal
Signal processing
scipy.sparse
Sparse matrices
scipy.spatial
Spatial data structures and algorithms
scipy.special
Any special mathematical functions
scipy.stats
Statistics
Data Structure
The basic data structure used by SciPy is a multidimensional array provided by the NumPy module. NumPy provides some functions for Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms and Random Number Generation, but not with the generality of the equivalent functions in SciPy.
